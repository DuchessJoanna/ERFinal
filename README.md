# ERFinal
2022 Fall Extended Reality CS 4743 Final Team 3

=-=
11/1/2022:
Please follow these instructions to follow along with the workflow.
1. Go to your Unity Hub and install and set as your default Unity 2021.3.8f1
2. Create a new project called "Final" using the default 3D Core, and no other changes.

The workflow will come in two parts:

1.
All assets we create and share in this github will go into the assets folder of the Unity project.
Whenever assets are created or updated here, copy them into your personal assets folder.
Whenever you create or update assets, copy them into here.
This includes the Scenes/SampleScene.unity which includes the data for where are the objects actually are and are set up in the scene
So whenever you change aspects of the above, make sure to re-upload your version of that file.

2.
Whenever you are working on some aspect of the project, send a short message in the Discord chat notifying us of what your planned work is;
this will alleviate overlap.
